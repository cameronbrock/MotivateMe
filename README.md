# About MotivateMe

MotivateMe is a fun little Python program for randomly selecting motivational quotes from a file (utils/quotes.jsonl) and outputting them randomly to the terminal. Each quote is stored as a JSON object in quotes.jsonl. By default, there are only two quotes included with the project, from Meditations by Marcus Aurelius (one of my favorite books, incidentally!). However, more can easily be added by adding additional quote objects to the quotes.jsonl file. I designed the output to be fun and visually appealing, with a pretty box around the output and sparkles.

# Installation

If you'd like to install MotivateMe, you can clone the github repository and add the directory to your PATH. If you use the Bash shell, I have written a handy autoinstall.sh script which will allow you to install the scripts in /usr/local/src and add an executable file to /usr/local/bin. If you're planning to use the autoinstaller script, make sure to run it as root or with sudo!
